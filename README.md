ðŸ”´ **This gem is still in Alpha and has not been tested on Production** ðŸ”´

This is a Rails Engine that makes it easy to work with Stripe Subscriptions. Checking a user's subscription and getting the user to subscribe to a plan is as simple as,

```ruby
# app/controllers/paid_features_controller.rb
class PaidFeaturesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    if current_user.active_stripe_subcsriptions? # fetches subscription details from Stripe
      render
    else
      redirect_to stripe_subscribe.plans_path # to select and pay for a plan
    end
  end
end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stripe-subscribe'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

## Getting Started

Install and run the migrations:

```bash
$ rails stripe_subscribe:install:migrations
$ rails db:migrate
```

This is a view of the files that have to be updated on the Rails app. Don't panic.

```
.
â”œâ”€ config
â”‚Â Â â”œâ”€ stripe
â”‚Â Â â”‚Â Â â””â”€ plans.rb
â”‚Â Â â””â”€ routes.rb
â””â”€ app
 Â Â â”œâ”€ models
 Â Â â”‚Â Â â””â”€ user.rb
 Â Â â””â”€ controllers
 Â Â  Â Â â””â”€ paid_features_controller.rb
```

Configure your plans at `config/stripe/plans.rb`. This will be uploaded to Stripe and used to render the plans page,

```ruby
# config/stripe/plans.rb
Stripe.plan :pro do |plan|
  plan.name = 'Professional'
  plan.amount = 1999
  plan.currency = 'usd'
  plan.interval = 'month'
end
```

Run this to upload the plans to Stripe,

```bash
$ rake stripe:prepare
```

Update the routes to mount the engine. Make sure that it is mounted by Devise's `authenticate` helper so only authenticated resources have access to the routes. This will be where users get to select a plan and pay for it.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  authenticate :user do
    mount Stripe::Subscribe::Engine => "/stripe/subscribe"
  end
end
```

Include the module to mix in Stripe subscription methods to the `User`.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Stripe::Subscriberable
end
```

With the new methods you will be able to retrieve a user's Stripe customer or subscription status, note that `stripe_subscribe.plans_path` will take the user to a page with the plans listed on `config/stripe/plans.rb`. They will then be able to select a plan and pay for them on those pages.

```ruby
# app/controllers/paid_features_controller.rb
class PaidFeaturesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    if current_user.active_stripe_subcsriptions?
      render
    else
      redirect_to stripe_subscribe.plans_path
    end
  end
end
```
